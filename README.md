MusicLink is a React web for the Panda Hacks 2025 hackathon, designed to motivate students by connecting them with "companions" through music. It features five anime characters matched by song tastes, allowing users to chat using written dialogues. No actual music is included due to copyright. This project reflects my love for my 推し sssss ♡
